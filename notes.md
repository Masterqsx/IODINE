# TODO

* Generate dSprite dataset
* Train on dSprite.

* Inspect the possibility of memory use and improve training efficiency
* Figure out CLEVR generation
* Train on dSprite
* Train on Tetris
* Implement ARI score
* Implement factor regression
* Implement feature disentanglement
* Implement generalization score

# Problem

* Why is the factor "shape" hard to learn?
* Why the segmentation is not exact?
