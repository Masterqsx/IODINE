# TODO

* Generate dSprite dataset
* Train on dSprite.

* Figure out CLEVR generation
* Train on dSprite
* Train on Tetris
* Implement ARI score
* Implement factor regression
* Implement feature disentanglement
* Implement generalization score

# Problem

* Why is the factor "shape" hard to learn?
* Why the segmentation is not exact?

# how do you do disentanglement exp?

* choose an image
* through the network
* get z_1 to z_k, mu_1 to mu_k, sigma_1 to sigma_k 
* rank according to kl
* for i in range(5)
